Interactive Data Visualization on the Electoral Bond Data Released by the Election Commission of India 


Welcome to the Electoral Bonds Visualization Project! 

This project analyzes the electoral bonds data published by the Election Commission of India (ECI) on 21 March 2024. The data is disclosed by the State Bank of India (SBI) under the orders of the Honâ€™ble Supreme Court of India. Earlier, this data was protected by the Electoral Bond Scheme 2018, which allowed entities donating to political parties to maintain anonymity. The SC invalidated it, citing the right to information, and asked SBI to make it public. 

 It provides insights into India's political funding landscape.
